# OracleJRE 8 Docker Image

This image is built on the combined work of [frol](https://github.com/frol) and [develar](https://github.com/develar).
Using Alpine Linux as the base the initial size is only 5MB, combined with OracleJRE 8, this image is just under 160MB.

While [alpine-oraclejdk8](https://github.com/frol/docker-alpine-oraclejdk8) offers an up-to-date Oracle*JDK* and [java](https://github.com/develar/docker-java) offers a neglected OracleJRE. This image combines the work of both repos, offering smaller size, and newer Alpine Linux and Java 8 versions.
